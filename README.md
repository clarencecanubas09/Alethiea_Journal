The Aletheia Journal System is a digital emotional journaling application designed to help users better understand, track, and manage their emotions through reflective writing and personalized feedback. Unlike traditional mood trackers that rely on simple emoji selection or predefined labels, Aletheia encourages users to express their thoughts in natural language, allowing for deeper emotional articulation and more meaningful self‑reflection. The system integrates a personality assessment that classifies users into one of four macro personality types—Extroverted Analysts, Extroverted Diplomats, Introverted Analysts, or Introverted Diplomats. This personality framework enables the system to tailor its emotional support messages to match each user’s communication style, cognitive tendencies, and emotional patterns, creating a more human‑centered and empathetic journaling experience.
The system operates through a structured workflow that guides users from account creation to daily emotional evaluation. After signing up and logging in, users complete a personality assessment that becomes the foundation for generating personalized insights. Each day, the system presents guided reflection prompts that help users express their current emotional state, and their responses are analyzed to determine their mood category—Depressed, Sad, Neutral, Happy, or Amazing. Using both the identified mood and the user’s personality type, the system generates a customized emotional support message designed to comfort, motivate, or encourage the user based on their current state. All journal entries and mood logs are stored with timestamps, allowing users to review their emotional history, observe patterns, and gain a deeper understanding of their mental well‑being over time.
